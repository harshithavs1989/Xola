   This project has been executed on windows 10 Firefox 45.2, Chrome 68.0. This is also stablized on the same versions. There is a issue with selection of the date in the calendar. Since I do not know why this issue is present, where date selected becomes invalidated I am not able to solve it. But automation code does run when the date can be selected properly.
